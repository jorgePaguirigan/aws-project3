# Phase 2 - Deployment

**File:** `src/agent_orchestrator.py`

In this phase, implement the functions that create the guardrail, deploy the runtime and configure Memory. Do not run the full deployment yet. First complete these functions, then continue to Phase 3 to create the Knowledge Bases and Phase 4 to implement observability. You will deploy and test the complete system in Phase 4.

## Task 3 — Guardrail and Runtime Deployment

### Background

Bedrock Guardrails(opens in a new tab) filter model inputs and outputs. AgentCore Runtime(opens in a new tab) hosts your agent application. This project deploys the runtime using the AgentCore CLI, through the supplied `src/agentcore_cli.py` helper.

### Implement `create_guardrail()`

Create a Bedrock Guardrail using the `bedrock` client with these policies:

- **Content policy:** SEXUAL, VIOLENCE and HATE at HIGH strength; INSULTS and MISCONDUCT at MEDIUM strength.
- **PII policy:** BLOCK credit card numbers and SSNs; ANONYMIZE emails and phone numbers.
- **Topic policy:** DENY competitor products, pricing negotiations and legal threats.
- **Word policy:** Enable the managed profanity list.
- Include friendly blocked messages for both inputs and outputs.

For the topic policy, use `topicPolicyConfig.tierConfig = {"tierName": "STANDARD"}` and top-level `crossRegionConfig = {"guardrailProfileIdentifier": "us.guardrail.v1:0"}`. Define pricing negotiations as haggling or requests to change an advertised price, while allowing calculations using a specified price and discount. This avoids the false positive observed with the project's math scenario on the Classic tier.

Publish a numbered version with `create_guardrail_version()` and return `(guardrail_id, guardrail_version)`. Use that numbered version, not `DRAFT`. During final testing, verify that the math question and its answer are allowed and that negotiation, competitor and legal-threat examples are blocked.

### Implement `deploy_to_agentcore_runtime()`

The supplied code stages your application and helper modules in `build/runtime/`. Complete the TODO to:

- Build the runtime environment variables: `AWS_REGION`, `PROJECT_NAME`, `RETURNS_KB_ID`, `SHIPPING_KB_ID`, `WARRANTY_KB_ID`, `AGENT_LOG_GROUP`, `GUARDRAIL_ID` and `GUARDRAIL_VERSION`.
- Pass them to `agentcore_cli.configure_runtime()` with `network_mode='PUBLIC'`, `protocol='HTTP'` and `execution_role_arn=config.AGENTCORE_ROLE_ARN`.
- Call `agentcore_cli.deploy()`. The CLI packages the application and deploys it through CloudFormation.
- Read the ARN with `agentcore_cli.deployed_runtime_arn()` and return it.

Do not implement a direct `create_agent_runtime()` SDK call. The supplied `_apply_guardrail()` applies the guardrail to each agent's model using the ID and version provided in the runtime environment variables.

## Task 4 — Memory

### Background

AgentCore Memory(opens in a new tab) provides storage for conversation context. This task configures a Memory resource with a session-summary strategy and seven-day event retention.

### Implement `configure_memory(runtime_arn)`

Create the resource with `agentcore_control.create_memory()`, using the `summaryMemoryStrategy` and `eventExpiryDuration=7`. The supplied code waits for the resource to become ACTIVE; return its ARN.

## Next step

Continue to Phase 3 — Knowledge Bases, then implement observability in Phase 4. The full deployment calls both the Memory and Observability functions and requires all three Knowledge Base IDs. Phase 4 contains the deployment and test commands.
