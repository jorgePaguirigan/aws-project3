# Phase 3 - Knowledge Bases

**Location:** AWS Console (no code changes required)

In this phase, you will create three Bedrock Knowledge Bases — one per policy domain. These are the data sources that power the parallel multi-agent RAG system you built in Phase 1.

## Background: Bedrock Knowledge Bases with S3 Vectors

A Knowledge Base is a managed RAG service — point it at an S3 prefix and Bedrock handles chunking, embedding (Titan Embed Text v2), and vector indexing into S3 Vectors (serverless, no OpenSearch needed). S3 Vectors is a separate service from general-purpose S3: a Knowledge Base needs a vector bucket and one vector index per KB. Your CloudFormation stack created both — run `python config.py` to see their names. The `bedrock-agent-runtime.retrieve()` API returns the top-k relevant passages. See: Bedrock Knowledge Bases (opens in a new tab)

## Step 1: Verify policy documents

The policy documents were uploaded to S3 when you ran `seed_data.py` during environment setup. They are organized under three prefixes:

```text
s3://{policy-docs-bucket}/policies/returns/    ← returns policy documents
s3://{policy-docs-bucket}/policies/shipping/   ← shipping policy documents
s3://{policy-docs-bucket}/policies/warranty/   ← warranty policy documents
```

You can verify in the AWS Console:

1. Navigate to AWS Console → S3
2. Open the bucket named `udacity-agentcore-policy-docs-{ACCOUNT_ID}-{suffix}` (the exact name is the Policy Bucket line of `python config.py`)
3. Navigate to the `policies/` prefix
4. Verify you see three folders: `returns/`, `shipping/`, `warranty/`, each containing policy documents

Alternatively, in AWS CloudShell (browser-based shell with AWS CLI pre-installed):

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://$(python -c "import config; print(config.POLICY_BUCKET)")/policies/ --recursive
```

## Step 2: Create three Knowledge Bases in the AWS Console

Navigate to: AWS Console → Amazon Bedrock → Knowledge Bases → Create Knowledge Base

Create three KBs with these settings (one per domain):

| Setting | Returns KB | Shipping KB | Warranty KB |
|---|---|---|---|
| Name | `novamart-returns-policy-kb` | `novamart-shipping-policy-kb` | `novamart-warranty-policy-kb` |
| S3 data source prefix | `policies/returns/` | `policies/shipping/` | `policies/warranty/` |
| Embedding model | Amazon Titan Embed Text v2 | Amazon Titan Embed Text v2 | Amazon Titan Embed Text v2 |
| Vector store | S3 Vectors → Use an existing vector bucket | same | same |
| S3 Vectors bucket | Vector Bucket from `python config.py` (`udacity-agentcore-vectors-…`) | same | same |
| Vector index | `returns-policy-index` | `shipping-policy-index` | `warranty-policy-index` |

> **Do not choose Managed KB** — that creates a different vector bucket than the one the project (and the rubric) expects, and the backing store cannot be changed afterwards. Use **Self-managed KBs**.

After creating each KB, click **Sync** to index the documents.

## Step 3: Add KB IDs to your `.env`

Copy each Knowledge Base ID from the console and add to your `.env`:

```env
RETURNS_KB_ID=<your-returns-kb-id>
SHIPPING_KB_ID=<your-shipping-kb-id>
WARRANTY_KB_ID=<your-warranty-kb-id>
```

## Test your work

```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task5
```

## Tips

- After creating a KB, you **MUST** click "Sync" before queries will return results
- If retrieval returns empty results, check that your KB IDs in `.env` match the console
- The S3 Vectors bucket and the three indexes were already created by the CloudFormation stack you deployed earlier; `python tests/test_agent.py task5` reports which vector store each KB uses
