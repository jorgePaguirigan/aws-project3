# Phase 4 - Observability & Testing

**File:** `src/agent_orchestrator.py`

In this final phase, you will enable observability for your deployed agent system and run the end-to-end submission tests.

## Task 6 — Observability

### Background: AgentCore Observability

AgentCore Observability routes execution data to CloudWatch Logs (reasoning chains, tool calls, responses) and AWS X-Ray (distributed latency traces across the full Orchestrator → Worker call chain). See: AgentCore Observability (opens in a new tab)

### What to implement

#### `configure_observability(runtime_arn)`

Configure logging and tracing for the AgentCore runtime by building a `loggingConfiguration` dict and passing it to the pre-written `apply_observability_config()`:

- **CloudWatch Logs (`cloudWatchConfig`):** Point to `config.AGENT_LOG_GROUP`, set INFO-level logging, enable it
- **X-Ray (`xRayConfig`):** Enable tracing with 100% sampling rate

`apply_observability_config()` turns that into real AWS state: it enables CloudWatch Transaction Search (the mechanism AgentCore Observability uses) at the sampling percentage you chose, creates the log group, and stores the settings as environment variables on your runtime so the deployed agent logs and traces exactly as configured.

**How traces reach X-Ray.** The pre-written `agent_observability.py` records every request as one X-Ray trace: each `route_to_*` tool becomes a worker-agent node and each Knowledge Base retrieval a `KnowledgeBase:*` node. It works the same from your machine (`test`, `chat`, `demo`) and inside the deployed runtime (`invoke`), so the Service Map below shows the real call chain of your code.

### Test your work

```bash
python tests/test_agent.py task6
```

After the automated tests pass, send a test request through the system:

```bash
python src/agent_orchestrator.py test
```

Each scenario prints its X-Ray trace id. Then navigate to **AWS Console → CloudWatch → X-Ray traces → Service map** (also reachable as **X-Ray → Service map**) and select **Last 5 minutes**. You should see a trace graph showing the full call chain from `NovaMart-Orchestrator` through to the worker agents and Knowledge Bases.

### Tips

- X-Ray traces may take 30–60 seconds to appear in the console after invocation
- Set `samplingRate=1.0` during development so every request is traced

## End-to-End Submission Test

With all tasks complete, run the full deployment:

```bash
python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy
```

Test these scenarios manually to verify your system handles all three request types:

| Scenario | Expected Routing |
|---|---|
| "I want to return my order ORD-27176" (as CUST-001) | Orchestrator → Inventory → Refund → Communication |
| "What is the return policy for premium customers?" | Orchestrator → Policy (3 parallel KB retrievers) → Communication |
| "How much are 5 items at $29.99 with 10% off?" | Orchestrator → CommunicationAgent; skip Inventory, Policy and Refund |

Run the full test suite one final time:

```bash
python tests/test_agent.py all
```

### Required deliverables

1. Take a screenshot that shows that all tests passed, and shows that you have 120 scores.
2. Take a screenshot of your X-Ray Service Map after running a live request. Navigate to **AWS Console → CloudWatch → X-Ray traces → Service map** and capture the full trace graph showing the Orchestrator → Worker call chain.

## Clean Up

After you have taken your screenshots and submitted the project, delete everything it created so the AWS account stops incurring charges:

```bash
python infrastructure/cleanup.py          # dry run - lists what would be deleted
python infrastructure/cleanup.py --yes    # deletes it
```

**Clean up after submitting.** Nothing in the reviewed submission depends on the resources still existing, but you may need them again if the reviewer asks for changes.
